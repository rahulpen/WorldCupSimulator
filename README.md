# World-Cup-Simulator
Welcome to my wip World Cup Simulator. This simulation runs a world cup style tournament with the 32 2018 World Cup Teams.
The teams attributes are based off the FIFA September 6, 2018 rankings, using the offense, midfield, defensive, and overall team ratings to determine winners
of matches. There is some chance and luck involved to allow for upsets to occur during the matches to keep the tournament.
